TPW Installer
======

This small set of files act as a lightweight installer for the TPW MODS package. This collection was proven to be essential for a thorough enjoyement of [ArmA III](http://www.arma3.com/), thanks to the life it brings in what are otherwise barren and uninhabited islands.

What this package does is to provide an easy installing experience, hopefully reducing problems that inevitably arise when moving files around; it should also completely automate updates on `TPW MODS.hpp` and any presets, meaning you won't have to manually add lines whenever [tpw](http://forums.bistudio.com/member.php?62814-tpw) adds new parameters. The installer itself is a simple batch script, while the config updater (still work in progress) is written in C++.
